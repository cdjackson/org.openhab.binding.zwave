The ZXT-120 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

The ZXT-120 is a Z-Wave to air-conditioner (AC) IR Extender and it works with any Z-Wave compliant gateway which supports the same command classes (check with your gateway support for compatibility) or portable controller by translating Z-Wave’s Thermostat commands to AC IR control code. User can set the IR code from the built-in code library of ZXT-120 through the configuration commands, or use the learning function of ZXT-120 through the UI on gateway. ZXT-120 also built in a temperature sensor that allow to report your room temperature to home gateway.

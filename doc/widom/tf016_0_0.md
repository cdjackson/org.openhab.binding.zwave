## Overview

The Heatit Z-Wave is an electronic thermostat for floor heating in a standard wall box. The thermostat has a built-in Z-Wave chip that can be connected with Home Automation systems.

Heatit Z-Wave is equipped with a single pole switch and fits into most System 55 frames (Elko RS16, Schneider Exxact, Gira, Jung etc.) The thermostat can withstand a load of max 16A / 3600W at 230V. At higher loads the thermostat must control a contactor. The thermostat may be connected to two wired external sensors.

The thermostat has the capacity of up to 8 associations (relays, wall plugs etc.)

The thermostat is designed for electrical heating.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TF016 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 8 nodes.

### Group 2: On/Off control


Association group 2 supports 8 nodes.

The 004001 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

## Overview

# Secure Z-Wave Smoke Sensor plus Siren

This product combines a certified stand-alone smoke detector with an insertable Z-Wave module. The smoke detector is certified by the VdS and DIN EN 14604 and satisfies all legal requirements. The smokebox is made of steel and antistatic plastic.

A button on the device can be used to test the smokebox, the electronics and the battery. In addition the device has an integrated test functionality to make manual tests with Aerosol unnecessary. The battery warning gets send for at least 30 days. During this time the smoke sensor stays fully functional.

The Z-Wave radio module enables the smoke and battery alarms to be transmitted to a central Z-Wave controller. The smoke sensor can also be used as Z-Wave siren; for that the Z-Wave controller sends an on or off command to the siren. The radio module uses either the smoke sensors integrated 9V battery or can be powered by an external 12V power supply.

According to the VdS 3515 (smoke sensors with radio communication) this device will relay all alarms to all other smoke sensors (004001) in the Z-Wave network to create a house-wide alarm. This connection of the smoke sensors is fully automatical and needs no further configuration. The smoke sensors and the controller communicate via an secure protocol to prevent manipulation.

### Inclusion Information

A single click on the button (3) includes the device. If the button is pressed for at least 2 seconds the inclusion will be done without the (Security Command Class ). 

### Exclusion Information

A single click on the button will exclude the device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 6 configuration parameters available in the 004001.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Siren alarm sequence interval in seconds | This parameter defines the total length of the interval in seconds. |
| 2 | Siren alarm tone length | Total length of the sound versus silence within this interval. |
| 3 | Value of On-Command |  |
| 4 | Value of Off-Command |  |
| 5 | Status of automated meshing of smoke alarms | Inform other smoke detectors of same type about smoke alarms |
| 6 | Status of automated meshing of battery alarms | Inform other smoke detectors of same type about battery alarms |

### Parameter 1: Siren alarm sequence interval in seconds

This parameter defines the total length of the interval in seconds.
The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm. This sound is partly on and partly off. This parameter defines the total length of the interval in seconds.
Values in the range 3 to 129 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Siren alarm tone length

Total length of the sound versus silence within this interval.
The additional siren is creating a different acoustic signal differentiate from the smoke alarm. This sound is partly on and partly off. This parameter defines the total length of the sound versus silence within this interval.
Values in the range 3 to 129 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```10```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Value of On-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```99```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 4: Value of Off-Command



Values in the range 0 to 99 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Status of automated meshing of smoke alarms

Inform other smoke detectors of same type about smoke alarms
This smoke detector can automatically inform other smoke detectors of same type about smoke alarms. They will then also turn on the siren. This function is a requirement of wireless networked smoke detectors.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | inactive |
| 1 | active |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (active).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 6: Status of automated meshing of battery alarms

Inform other smoke detectors of same type about battery alarms
This smoke detector can automatically inform other smoke detectors of same type about battery alarms. They will then also turn on the siren. This function is a requirement of wireless networked smoke detectors.
The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | inactive |
| 1 | active |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (active).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_6_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 004001 supports 3 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 2: Alarm Reports


Association group 2 supports 4 nodes.

### Group 3: Switching Command when Alarm


Association group 3 supports 4 nodes.

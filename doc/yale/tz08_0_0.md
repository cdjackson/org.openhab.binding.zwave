The TZ08 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is designed to switch rise/lower roller shutter connected to its terminals using radio waves, controllers and a push button directly connected to this Roller Controller.

This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is a transceiver which is a Z-WaveTM enabled device and is fully compatible with any Z-WaveTM enabled network. Slim design let the Controller can easily hide itself into the wall box and that will be good for the house decoration.

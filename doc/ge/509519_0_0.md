The 509519 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

Movement/presence detectors switch on as soon as they detect a moving heat source. This can be a person, but also animals, trees, cars or differences in temperature in windows. In order to avoid false alarms, the chosen installation site should be such that undesired heat sources cannot be detected (see section „Selecting the installation site“). 

### Inclusion Information

Turn the controller A on the ARGUS to position B: The learning mode is activated. 

### Exclusion Information

Turn the controller A on the ARGUS to position B: The learning mode is activated.

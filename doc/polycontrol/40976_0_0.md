The Keemple smart radiator supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The Keemple smart radiator does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

It is battery powered, compact and very easy to operate with only three buttons on the front.

Technical Features

  * Easy to operate - only three buttons
  * Open window function
  * Valve exercise function
  * PID control (precise control)
  * Battery lifetime 2 years

To reset the device, you have to take the batteries out, hold the button, put the batteries back in and continue holding the button for > 5 s for the device to reset.

### Inclusion Information

Device must reset the device and than short push middle button.

### Exclusion Information

You have to take the batteries out, hold the button, put the batteries back in and continue holding the button for > 5 s for the device to reset.

### Wakeup Information

The Keemple smart radiator does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Short push middle button.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the Keemple smart radiator -:

| Channel Name | Channel ID | Channel Type | Category | Item Type |
|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Water temperature | sensor_power | sensor_power |  |  | 
| Sensor (temperature) | sensor_temperature | sensor_temperature |  |  | 
| Setpoint (heating) | thermostat_setpoint | thermostat_setpoint |  |  | 
| Battery Level | battery-level | system.battery_level | Battery | Number |
| Clock Time Offset | time_offset | time_offset |  |  | 

### Water temperature
Sensor\_power channel is used because water\_temperature channel is not supported.

Channel type information on this channel is not found.

### Sensor (temperature)

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The device does not support associations.

The TZ77 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

12V DC operating voltage.

This insert switch module is a transceiver which is a Z-Wave enabled device  
and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave enabled network.  
Remote on/off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer's  
wireless controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater.

### Inclusion Information

Pressing ON/OFF button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter inclusion mode.

### Exclusion Information

Pressing ON/OFF button three times within 1.5 seconds will enter exclusion mode.

### Wakeup Information

The TZ77 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

## Device Configuration

The following table provides a summary of the 2 configuration parameters available in the TZ77.
Detailed information on each parameter can be found in the sections below.

| Param | Name  | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Indicator light state | Change the state of indicator light |
| 2 | Memory function | Socket status when powered on |
|  | Switch All Mode | Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands |

### Parameter 1: Indicator light state

Change the state of indicator light
Default status of socket: LED is on as indicator when the load is off
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Memory function

Socket status when powered on
Default with memory: the socket status is same as before when power on
Values in the range 0 to 1 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

### Switch All Mode

Set the mode for the switch when receiving SWITCH ALL commands.

The following option values may be configured -:
| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Exclude from All On and All Off groups |
| 1 | Include in All On group |
| 2 | Include in All Off group |
| 255 | Include in All On and All Off groups |

This parameter has the configuration ID ```switchall_mode``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The TZ77 supports 2 association groups.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.
Group 1

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.

### Group 2: Group 2

Group 2

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

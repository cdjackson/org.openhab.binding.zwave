The 09813 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The 09813 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The Home Control Smoke Detector alarms you acoustically via an unmistakable signal sound, visually via an LED light and, if used with the devolo Home Control Central Unit, via text, e-mail or app. Thanks to the mobile and simultaneous notification sent to multiple mobile phone numbers and e-mail addresses that you select, you can respond immediately even when on the go. When combined with other Home Control devices, the Home Control Smoke Detector can, for example, additionally turn on the lights and open the shades via the Z-Wave® controller

### Inclusion Information

Press the program switch for 1 second at least to be included.

### Exclusion Information

Press the program switch for 1 second at least to be excluded.

### Wakeup Information

The 09813 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


Press program switch once, the detector will send NIF signal first and will also send “Wake Up Notification” after 3 seconds

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The 09813 supports 1 association group.

### Group 2: Battery capacity low

The Home Control Smoke Detector continuously checks the battery capacity. If the battery capacity falls below a defined value of approx. 2.7V +-0.1V, a low battery alarm will be sent via Z-Wave®. If the capacity continues falling, the visual and acoustic battery capacity warning will be activated additionally.

Association group 2 supports 5 nodes.

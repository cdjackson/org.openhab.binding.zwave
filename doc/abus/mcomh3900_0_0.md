The MH3900 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

MH3900 automatically detects the indoor temperature and display the relevant temperature value for heating control. It also can automatically run on/off the heating system according to the temperature differences. The device can be remotely controlled by Z-Wave network.

### Inclusion Information

Under normal working interface, long press S1+S3 to enter in Z-Wave Inclusion/Exclusion interface, interface shows "\---" which means the device is not included in the network). Short press s2, the device enter into learning mode, after learning mode is completed, the device shows Node ID.

### Exclusion Information

Under normal working interface, long press S1+S3 to enter in Z-Wave Inclusion/Exclusion interface, interface shows the current Node ID. Short press s2, after some time the node ID will be released and the device will show " \---" again.

## Channels

The following table summarises the channels available for the MH3900 -:

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The MH3900 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

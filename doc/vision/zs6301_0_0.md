The ZS6301 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZS6301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

This device is measuring the CO concentration in the air and issues an alarm when a certain level of CO is exceeded.

### Inclusion Information

Press the test switch of ZS6301-5 once to be included. 

### Exclusion Information

Press the test switch of ZS6301-5 once to be excluded. 

### Wakeup Information

The ZS6301 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


To leave “Sleep” mode, please press the test switch once, the device will send “Wake Up Notification” after 10 seconds.

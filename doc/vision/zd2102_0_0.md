The ZD2102 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The ZD2102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The ZD2102 Door and Window sensor is used in any Z-Wave network to detect the opening or closing of a door or window. Special Design can fit most of door/window frame. The primary sensing element is a magnetic reed switch, the ZD2102 is supplied with the sensor, sensor mounting bracket and the trigger magnet. An additional set of sensor inputs are provided through a 2 position screw terminal and can be used to expand the sensor capability to multiple inputs. The ZD2102 is powered by a single CR123A Lithium Battery (supplied with unit, battery life is more than 5 years) and is intended for indoor use only. The ZD2102 features tamper proof switch, low battery warning and can be firmware updated over the air.

### Inclusion Information

Press the program switch

### Exclusion Information

Press the program switch for at least 1 second

### Wakeup Information

The ZD2102 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.

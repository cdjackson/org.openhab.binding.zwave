The PSM08 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is unable to participate in the routing of data from other devices.

The PSM08 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. Refer to the *Wakeup Information* section below for further information.

## Overview

The door/window sensor PSM08 has door/window sensor function, based on Z-WaveTM technology.This device is a Security Enabled Z-Wave Plus Product.

### Inclusion Information

  1.  Have Z-WaveTM Controller entered inclusion mode.
  2.  Pressing button once to enter the inclusion mode.
  3.  After add successful, the device will wake to receive the setting command from Z-WaveTM Controller about 20 seconds.

### Exclusion Information

  1.  Have Z-WaveTM Controller entered exclusion mode.
  2.  Pressing button once to enter the exclusion mode. Node ID has been excluded

### Wakeup Information

The PSM08 does not permanently listen for messages sent from the controller - it will periodically wake up automatically to check if the controller has messages to send, but will sleep most of the time to conserve battery life. The wakeup period can be configured in the user interface - it is advisable not to make this too short as it will impact battery life - a reasonable compromise is 1 hour.

The wakeup period does not impact the devices ability to report events or sensor data. The device can be manually woken with a button press on the device as described below - note that triggering a device to send an event is not the same as a wakeup notification, and this will not allow the controller to communicate with the device.


After the device adding to the network, it will wake-up once per day in default. When it wake-up it will broadcast the “Wake Up Notification” message to the network, and wake-up 10 seconds for receive the setting commands. The wake-up interval minimum setting is 30 minutes, and maximum setting is 12 hours. And the interval step is 30 minutes. If the user want to wake-up the device immediately, please remove the front cover, and press the button once. The device will wake-up 10 seconds.

## Device Configuration

The device has no configuration parameters defined.

## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The PSM08 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 1 node.

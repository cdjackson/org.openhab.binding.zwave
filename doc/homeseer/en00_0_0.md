The EN00 supports routing. This allows the device to communicate using other routing enabled devices as intermediate routers.  This device is also able to participate in the routing of data between other devices in the mesh network.

## Overview

The meter adapter measures gas and electricity usage of analog meters. The analog meters are read by means of optical sensors that can be placed on the meter to monitor the rotating disc or the blinking LED. The meter adapter measures the cumulative and instantaneous gas and electricity consumption.

### Inclusion Information

To add the Meter Module into a Z-Wave network, the inclusion process should be started on the controller. In factory default mode, the Meter Module will try to join a Z-Wave network automatically after being plugged into a power socket. If the Meter Module was previously included in a Z-Wave network, or was not just plugged into a power socket, one needs to triple-press the button (quickly).

### Exclusion Information

The button on the Meter Module should be triple-pressed (quickly).

## Channels

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_1_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 2: Analog gas/heat port resolution

Analog gas/heat port resolution
Analog gas/heat port resolution

(pulses per cubic meter / pulses per MJ; in Q14.2 notation)
Values in the range 120 to 40000 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_2_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 3: Analog electricity port mode

Analog electricity port mode

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Electricity import enabled |
| 2 | Electricity export enabled |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```1``` (Electricity import enabled).

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_3_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```400```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_4_4``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 5: Digital port mode

Digital port mode

Values in the range 0 to 2 may be set.

The manufacturer defined default value is ```2```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_5_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


### Parameter 255: Restart device

Restart device

The following option values may be configured -:

| Value  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Restart entire device |
| 2 | Restart metering chip |

The manufacturer defined default value is ```0```.

This parameter has the configuration ID ```config_255_1``` and is of type ```INTEGER```.


## Association Groups

Association groups allow the device to send unsolicited reports to the controller, or other devices in the network. Using association groups can allow you to eliminate polling, providing instant feedback of a device state change without unnecessary network traffic.

The EN00 supports 1 association group.

### Group 1: Lifeline

The Lifeline association group reports device status to a hub and is not designed to control other devices directly. When using the Lineline group with a hub, in most cases, only the lifeline group will need to be configured and normally the hub will perform this automatically during the device initialisation.

Association group 1 supports 5 nodes.
